h1. Leiningen Release Plug-in (tcrawley's fork of ato's fork)

Fork of "lein-release":https://github.com/relaynetwork/lein-release with a few tweaks for my preferences:

* Commit messages are simplified:
** @Release 1.0.0.@
** @Bump version to 1.0.1-SNAPSHOT.@
* SCM tag is just @1.0.0@ not @projectName-1.0.0@.
* Excess linefeeds in shell output removed.
* @:deploy-via :clojars@ uses @lein deploy clojars@ instead of scp
* allow overriding released version via @$RELEASE_VERSION@ and next dev version with @$NEXT_DEV_VERSION@

The release plug-in automatically manages your project's version and deploys the built artifact for you.

The plug-in performs the following steps:

1. Modify the project.clj to drop the "-SNAPSHOT" suffix
2. Add the project.clj to the SCM system
3. Commit the project.clj to the SCM system
4. Tag the project with @version@
5. If the project jar file does not exist, it builds it with @lein jar@ and @lein pom@
6. Performs a Deploy (see the Deploy section below)
7. Increments the project minor version number and re-adds the "-SNAPSHOT" suffix
8. Add the project.clj to the SCM system
9. Commit the project.clj to the SCM system

h1. Usage

pre.    lein plugin install org.clojars.ato/lein-release 1.0.1

pre.    lein release

h1. Configuration

The plug-in supports a @:lein-release@ map in the project.clj

h3. @:scm@

    @:lein-release {:scm :git}@

This can be used to specify the SCM (version control) system.  The release plug-in attempts to auto-detect the version control system by inspecting the current working directory (eg, for the @.git@ directory).  If this does not work for your project you can specify the SCM system explicitly.

h3. @:deploy-via@

    @:lein-release {:deploy-via :clojars}@

This can be used to explicitly specify the deployment strategy that will be used.  The currently supported values for this are:

* @:clojars@
* @:lein-deploy@
* @:lein-install@

The release plugin attempts to detect whether to use @:lein-deploy@ or @:lein-install@ by inspecting the project.clj.  If a @:repositories@ key is present in the project.clj @:lein-deploy@ will be used.  Otherwise @:lein-install@ will be used.  @:clojars@ will only be used if it is explicitly specified in the project.clj.

h2. Example Configuration

pre. (defproject org.clojars.relaynetwork/clj-avro "1.0.9-SNAPSHOT"
      :description "Avro Wrapper for Clojure"
      :dev-dependencies [[swank-clojure "1.4.2"]]
      :plugins [[lein-release "1.0.0-SNAPSHOT"]]
      :lein-release {:deploy-via :clojars}
      :local-repo-classpath true
      :dependencies [[org.clojure/clojure "1.2.0"]
                     ;; [org.apache.avro/avro "1.5.4"]
                     [org.apache.avro/avro "1.6.1"]
                     [org.clojure/clojure-contrib "1.2.0"]
                     [org.clojars.kyleburton/clj-etl-utils        "1.0.41"]])
    
h1. Deploy

The deployment strategy is determined by the following:

* if @:deploy-via@ is specified in the configuration, its value is used
* if the project.clj has a @:repositories@ setting, then @:lein-deploy@ is used
* otherwise @:lein-install@ is used

Deployment to clojars is handled by shelling out and running:

pre. scp project-VERSION.jar pom.xml clojars@clojars.org:

Deployment via Leiningen is handled by shelling out (for a deploy or install respectively).

h1. Supported SCM Systems

Currently only git is supported.  Provisions have been made in the plug-in to support more SCM systems in the future.  Patches are welcome!

h1. Limitations

The plug-in uses simple heuristics (regexes!) to modify the version string in the project.clj.  If you have multiple lines (or comments) that look like a defproject it may not be able to succeed.  This approach was taken in order to not rewrite the entire project.clj file and thus loose things like formatting, indentation or comments.
